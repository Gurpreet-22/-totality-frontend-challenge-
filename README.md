Approach
Component Design:

Home Component: Displays a list of properties with filters.
PropertyCard Component: Represents individual property listings.
Cart Component: Displays items added to the cart, allowing for quantity adjustments and removal.
Checkout Component: Handles the checkout process, including payment information.
State Management:

Context API: Used to manage the cart state across the application.
Local State: Managed within individual components for UI state like filters, contact information, etc.
Filtering Logic:

Filters: Allow users to filter properties based on location, price range, and number of bedrooms.
Implementation: Filtering is done by comparing property attributes against filter criteria.
Cart Management:

Adding to Cart: Users can add properties to the cart, which updates the cart state in CartContext.
Updating Cart: Users can adjust quantities or remove items, with changes reflected immediately in the cart.
Checkout Process:

Form Submission: Handles user input for contact and payment details, and processes the checkout.

Tech Stack
Frontend:
React: Main library for building the user interface.
Material-UI: UI library for pre-built components like buttons, cards, and forms.
Context API: For state management of the cart and other shared states.
React Router : For navigating between different pages (e.g., Home, Cart, Checkout).

File Structure:
src/components/: Contains reusable components like PropertyCard, Filter, Cart, and Checkout.
src/pages/: Contains page components like Home, CartPage, and CheckoutPage.
src/context/: Contains context provider and context files (e.g., CartContext).
src/utils/: Contains  mock data.
Styling:

Material-UI: Provides pre-designed components and styling.

Additional Notes

Image Handling:
Ensure that image paths in mockData are correctly set. Use correctly configure paths if you're using local images.
Images should be placed in the src/images directory and referenced correctly.

Context Setup:
CartContext should include methods for adding, removing, increasing, and decreasing items in the cart. This context should be wrapped around the main App component to ensure accessibility throughout the app.

Responsive Design:
Use Material-UI's Grid system to ensure that the layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.

Error Handling:
Implement error boundaries to handle unexpected issues gracefully.
Ensure proper validation for user inputs in the checkout form.

Testing:

Write unit tests for critical components and context functions to ensure they behave as expected.
Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library to test React components and state management.
Performance Optimization:

Use Reactâ€™s memoization techniques (e.g., React.memo, useMemo) to optimize rendering performance.
Consider lazy loading images and components to improve initial load times.
